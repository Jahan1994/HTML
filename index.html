<p style="font-size:20;"> Alī Imādud-Dīn Nasīmī (Azerbaijani: Seyid Əli İmadəddin Nəsimi سئید علی عمادالدّین نسیمی, Persian: عمادالدین نسیمی‎), 
    often known as Nesimi, (1369 – 1417 skinned alive in Aleppo) was a 14th-century Azerbaijani or Turkmen Ḥurūfī poet.
     Known mostly by his pen name (or takhallus) of Nesîmî, he composed one divan in Azerbaijani, one in Persian, and a number of poems in Arabic. 
     He is considered one of the greatest Turkic mystical poets of the late 14th and early 15th centuries and one of the most prominent early divan masters in Turkic literary history (the language used in this divan is the same with Azerbaijani).</p>

     <h2>LIFE</h2>
     <p style="font-size: 20;">Very little is known for certain about Nesîmî's life,
         including his real name. Most sources indicate that his name was İmâdüddîn,
          but it is also claimed that his name may have been Alî or Ömer. 
          It is also possible that he was descended from Muhammad, since he has sometimes been accorded the title of sayyid that is reserved for people claimed to be in Muhammad's line of descent.
          Nesîmî's birthplace, like his real name, is wrapped in mystery: 
          some claim that he was born in a province called Nesîm — hence the pen name — located either near Aleppo in modern-day Syria,
           or near Baghdad in modern-day Iraq, but no such province has been found to exist. 
           There are also claims that he was born in Shamakhi-which is mostly likely because his brother is buried in Shamakhi, Azerbaijan.
           From his poetry, it's evident that Nesîmî was an adherent of the Ḥurūfī movement, which was founded by Nesîmî's teacher Fażlullāh Astarābādī of Astarābād, who was condemned for heresy and executed in Alinja near Nakhchivan (Azerbaijan). The center of Fażlullāh's influence was Baku(Azerbaijan) and most of his followers came from Shirvan (Azerbaijan).

           Nesîmî become one of the most influential advocates of the Ḥurūfī doctrine and the movement's ideas were spread to a large extent through his poetry. While Fażlullāh believed that he himself was the manifestation of God, for Nesîmî, at the center of Creation there was God, who bestowed His Light on man. Through sacrifice and self perfection, man can become one with God. Around 1417, (or possibly 1404) as a direct result of his beliefs — which were considered blasphemous by contemporary religious authorities — Nesîmî was seized and, according to most accounts, skinned alive in Aleppo.
           
           A number of legends later grew up around Nesimi's execution, such as the story that he mocked his executioners with improvised verse and, after the execution, draped his flayed skin around his shoulders and departed. A rare historical account of the event — the Tarih-i Heleb of Akhmad ibn Ibrahim al-Halabi — relates that the court, which was of the Maliki school of religious law, was unwilling to convict Nesîmî of apostasy, and that the order of execution instead came from the secular power of the emir of Aleppo, who was hoping to avoid open rebellion.
           
           Nesîmî's tomb in Aleppo remains an important place of pilgrimage to this day.</p>

           <h2>POETRY</h2>
               <p style="font-size: 20;">Nesîmî's collected poems, or dîvân, number about 300, and include ghazals, qasidas (“lyrics”), and rubâ'îs (“quatrains”) in Azerbaijani Turkic, Persian, and Arabic. His Turkic Divan is considered his most important work, contains 250–300 ghazals and more than 150 rubâ'îs. A large body of Bektashi and Alevi poetry is also attributed to Nesîmî, 
                   
                largely as a result of Hurûfî ideas' influence upon those two groups.
                   One of Nesîmî's most famous poems is the gazel beginning with the following lines:</p>
